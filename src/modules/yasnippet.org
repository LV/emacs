#+TITLE: Yasnippet Configuration
#+AUTHOR: Luis Victoria
#+PROPERTY: header-args :tangle yes

A templating system. Allows you to type ~>TEMPLATE~ and then press ~TAB~ to expand the template

* Installation
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package yasnippet
    :ensure t
    :config
    (yas-global-mode 1))
#+end_src

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (add-hook 'org-mode-hook #'yas-minor-mode)

  ; TODO: Stop yasnippet from inserting an extra \n character after pressing TAB to open the snippet
  ;         This is probably only for org-mode, but maybe this behavior should be global
#+end_src

*** ~org-edit-special~
Open ~org-edit-special~ if generating a template with a code block

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (defun lv/org-edit-special-after-snippet ()
    "Call `org-edit-special` after a snippet expansion in Org mode."
    (when (org-in-src-block-p)
      (org-edit-special)))

  ;; Add this function to the yasnippet post expansion hook
  (add-hook 'yas-after-exit-snippet-hook 'lv/org-edit-special-after-snippet)

  ;; FIXME: If you choose to write code inside of a codeblock without invoking the ~org-edit-special~, assuming you are in insert mode, pressing newline will stop you from being able to write code down
  ;;          It formats the code, but forces you back into insert mode
  ;;          Perhaps disable this formatting, as we only want it to be formatted when we're inside of ~org-edit-special~, or maybe format it but keep us in insert mode
#+end_src

Return to Normal Mode (instead of Insert Mode) when leaving ~org-edit-special~

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (defun lv/exit-org-edit-special-normal-state ()
    "Force Evil to go to normal state after exiting `org-edit-special`."
    (when (org-in-src-block-p)
      (evil-normal-state)))

  ;; Advise `org-edit-src-exit` to ensure we're in normal state in Evil
  (advice-add 'org-edit-src-exit :after #'lv/exit-org-edit-special-normal-state)
#+end_src
