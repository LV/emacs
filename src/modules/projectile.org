#+TITLE: Projectile Configuration
#+AUTHOR: Luis Victoria
#+PROPERTY: header-args :tangle yes

* Pre-requisites
** Ripgrep
Despite =counsel-rg= using the ripgrep package in your system, =projectile-ripgrep= annoyingly requires the =ripgrep= Emacs package and will fail otherwise. Thus we need two copies of ripgrep ðŸ™„

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package ripgrep
    :ensure t)
#+end_src

* Installation
Projectile is a way of organizing your projects

By default, it takes a very long time for the projects to show up in ~projectile-switch-project~, so we create a helper function to invoke the search of these folders. I tried adding them straight under ~:config~ and it still wasn't working.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (defun lv/projectile-discover-projects()
    "Discover all projects in the search path"
    (interactive)
    (projectile-discover-projects-in-search-path))
#+end_src

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package projectile
    :diminish projectile-mode
    :init
    (setq projectile-switch-project-action #'projectile-dired)
    :config
    (setq projectile-enable-caching t)
    (projectile-mode 1)
    :bind-keymap
    ("C-c p" . projectile-command-map)
    :hook (projectile-mode . lv/projectile-discover-projects))
#+end_src

* Keybindings
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (lv/leader-keys
    "p"  '(:ignore p                       :which-key "project")
    "pa" '(projectile-add-known-project    :which-key "add")
    "pg" '(projectile-ripgrep              :which-key "ripgrep") ; TODO: Make it so that once you perform a search, the cursor automatically moves to this buffer
    "pp" '(projectile-switch-project       :which-key "switch")
    "pr" '(projectile-remove-known-project :which-key "switch"))
#+end_src
